# Kamlot

## Description
Kamlot is a 2 players game _-for now-_ where they compete against each other.
There are two characters that are in the game:
- The **Kamlot** which is a knight that is protecting **Sophia his Grandma** from various types of mobs.
- The **Mobs** are entities summoned by the **Grimmy the Witch** _-the second player-_ to kill the grandma.

The day and night cycle is a key element in the game. During night, **Grimmy** unlocks the ability to summon mobs, who are then getting in the house and trying to kill **Sophia**. This is the moment when **Kamlot** has to protect her by killing the mobs.

As soon as the sun rises, **Grimmy** loses the ability to summon mobs and **Kamlot** can't kill them anymore. She then heads back to her dungeon to recruit more mobs and wait for the night to come back.
During this time, **Kamlot** can earn himself a living by selling what he has collected during the night to the villagers.
With his earnings, he can buy new items such as swords, armors, potions, etc...

Furthermore, he can recruit new villagers that will help him fight **Grimmy**. Every 5 nights, **Grimmy** can't invade the house and **Kamlot** takes the opportunity to go to the dungeon and kill her.

## Gameplay
### Kamlot defending Sophia
- **Kamlot** has to kill the mobs that are trying to get in the house. He can move freely in the house, interact with **Sophia** by carrying her on his back. When he's not carrying **Sophia**, he can use his items to kill the mobs.
- **Grimmy** can summong mobs to kill sophia, this is a speed competition, she will have to write words (names of the mobs) and the location she wants to summon them in the house.

### During the day
- **Kamlot** can sell all the loot he has collected during the night, to the villagers which are located in the village. He may also buy items from them, or even help them by doing quests.
- **Grimmy's job** is to recruit mobs in her dungeon, the more time passes, the stronger the mobs are. At first, mobs are offensive to her but she can by taking care of them, like feeding them, washing them etc...

### Every 5 nights
Fights between **Kamlot** and **Grimmy** are happening. They are both tired from the previous nights, and instead of going in by themselves, they are sending their **minions** to fight for them. The game is a board game where pieces are the **minions** (mobs and villagers)
